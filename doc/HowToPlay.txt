    You can see the blue timer in the Arstotzka quadrant. This shows the remaining / elapsed time of the current day. At the end of each day, you will see your score based on your performance. You will get 10 points for every correct decision. You will get -10 points for every wrong decision. However, you will get -20 points if you 'approve' an entrant who should have been 'detained'. If your score is less than 0, the game ends. If your score is more or equal to 0, you can either a) continue the game (reset the timer), b) save the game and end.
